Recently I realized that I spent most of my time not on Twitter, Instagram, or whatever but exploring personal websites.

Many years ago I'm hanging out on social networks and trying to find a way how to express myself. But I can't express myself fully when I have only a few ways to do it. Owning my own website gives me the opportunity to do whatever I want to do.

Yeah, making a website is harder than creating a page on Instagram. But I didn't find any personal websites with naked boobs and butts which is advertising some rich lifestyle shit in each post. Instead, I've read a lot of interesting ideas, found a few easter eggs, play games, etc.

Finding good personal pages is hard but sometimes you'll find them and in most cases, it will be nice people behind them.

By the way, That's one of the reasons why I decided to start writing and adding something to my personal page. The piece of the internet that I own:)

Thanks for reading.
