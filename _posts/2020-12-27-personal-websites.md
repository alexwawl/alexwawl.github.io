Recently I realized that I spent my coffee-sipping time, not on Twitter, Instagram, or Facebook but exploring personal websites. It's hard to find them, but when I've found them in most cases it's a treasure.

Yeah, making a website is harder than creating a page on Instagram. But I didn't find any personal websites with naked boobs and butts which is advertising some bullshit. Instead, I've read a lot of interesting ideas and learned new stuff. Also, in most cases, you can find very nice people behind them.

One thing that I would love to have - searching/recommendation engine. Most of such good websites I found accidentally  :D

This is my piece of the internet that I own:) Would love to see yours.
