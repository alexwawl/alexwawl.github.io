It might be a podcast or a video blog. I have a lot of ideas in my head. How it should look like,  what I should talk about, how to share it with people, the concept behind all of it, etc. But for some reason, I did not start.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I‚Äôm holidaying right now. I have free time so I‚Äôve decided that I should try something. Yeah, it will not be the movie or professional podcast. I‚Äôll try to make something small and see do I love the process or not. If I‚Äôll fell in love with this process then I‚Äôll spend more time on it. But if not - then I can remove all of these ideas from my head. I can say that I tried but I didn‚Äôt love the process. That‚Äôs it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So maybe I‚Äôll start with some sort of short videos or maybe a short podcast. Anyway, I‚Äôm going to share at least something in the next few days.&lt;/p&gt;

It‚Äôs hard to find them, but when I‚Äôve found them in most cases it‚Äôs a treasure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yeah, making a website is harder than creating a page on Instagram. But I didn‚Äôt find any personal websites with naked boobs and butts which is advertising some bullshit. Instead, I‚Äôve read a lot of interesting ideas and learned new stuff. Also, in most cases, you can find very nice people behind them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One thing that I would love to have - searching/recommendation engine. Most of such good websites I found accidentally  :D&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is my piece of the internet that I own:) Would love to see yours.&lt;/p&gt;

It was one of my first interviews in such big companies with this classic onsite stage - a huge amount of coding, designing, talking about previous experience, culture contribution/fit, etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I just start gaining experience with this type of interview. Somewhere in the middle, I was already tired and exhausted. It was near the end of the onsite interview when 2 folks came into the room and said that they want to do one more coding round. They said it will be a quick one for ¬±40 minutes. So they give me a white piece of paper and a pen. The question was - Can you implement Game of Life?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I remember for a few seconds my brain just freezes and starts thinking about the philosophical meaning of this question. Anyway, after that freeze, I start asking questions like what does it mean, about what game they are talking about, etc. At that point, I felt that I‚Äôm not ‚Äúgeek‚Äù enough for them because I didn‚Äôt know this game. Actually, it was not a game - it was a cellular automaton devised by the British mathematician John Horton Conway in 1970. After all, time passing and I wrote down the rules of this into the paper, draw some simple interface, defined edge cases, and start writing the code for this &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zero-player_game&quot;&gt;zero-player game&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Short note: They were not a game company, or something related to this. They are far away from cellular automaton and games as I‚Äôm from inventing the new type of rocket that brings us to Mars in a few hours from any point of our planet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I would love to say that‚Äôs zero-player game sounds not very fun and in my head, I hold the idea - ‚Äúwho will play in it and what‚Äôs the idea of this‚Äù along the way. When code was ready and a lot of time passed they said - nice, it was the first part of this interview. So the second part sounds like - Can you design the web app, like chess.com where people can start the game, play together, move to the state of any point of the game timeline. It was the system design part of this interview.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So my brain just blew up. How few people can play in a zero-player game? O_o In front of me was a few papers with matrixes, some numbers, code, some notes about edge cases, rules, etc. I didn‚Äôt imagine how to play in this game alone, without anyone but they ask to implement an app where millions of people will play together against each other.
Somehow this discussion ended and after a few rounds, I left the office. I was a bit tired and really angry at myself. On the way to my hotel, I was thinking about how I didn‚Äôt know/hear about that game before. I thought that was my fault that I didn‚Äôt hear about it before.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the hotel, I opened my laptop, google about that game, saw the video, read the wiki, and when I saw how it should look like I‚Äôve decided to quickly implement it to understand better what‚Äôs the idea behind it. So I wrote that small piece of code that allows me to see and play this game. I‚Äôve added the teams to have a kind of competitive piece in this game and that‚Äôs it. It was fun for a few hours in the evening after the interview but that‚Äôs it. I never use this ‚Äúnew‚Äù knowledge. I only can say now - I know what is Game of Life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, I didn‚Äôt pass that round, and feedback of the interview was - ‚ÄúSpent too much time to implement a solution‚Äù. I was not upset or smth. I know that‚Äôs just the first interview. I‚Äôm training and trying to gain experience of how interviews in big companies look like. But one thing that I understand - an interview is not always about your skills or smth. It depends on many factors, sometimes on luck. Passing an interview it‚Äôs a skill and you can develop it. Nowadays, the rules of this big hiring game look like this. If you can change it - do it, if not - learn the rules and try to be the best at playing this game.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a reminder of this experience, I put this game on my website and you can play it. &lt;a href=&quot;/conways_game_of_life_teams&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;üëæ Play&lt;/a&gt;. Nowadays you can find a lot of courses, services, startups around hiring, passing coding interviews, etc. Looks like a new market born on top of it. Even I tried to build a small startup in this industry, but this story for another time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks for reading.&lt;/p&gt;

The goal for starting this blog - write more and do it frequently.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;English is not my first language, even not second, but I use it every day.
We communicate in text format a lot. Be able to explain ideas clearly and understandable is not bad :)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I would love to increase my writing skills by writing more and regularly. I‚Äôm not sure how it will look like and about what I‚Äôll write. 
It might be a long post or just a few sentences but I‚Äôll try to do it often.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, this is my first post. Let‚Äôs see where this leads.&lt;/p&gt;

Go ahead and edit it and re-build the site to see your changes. You can rebuild the site in many different ways, but the most common way is to run &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;jekyll serve&lt;/code&gt;, which launches a web server and auto-regenerates your site when a file is updated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jekyll requires blog post files to be named according to the following format:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;YEAR-MONTH-DAY-title.MARKUP&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Where &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;YEAR&lt;/code&gt; is a four-digit number, &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;MONTH&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;DAY&lt;/code&gt; are both two-digit numbers, and &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;MARKUP&lt;/code&gt; is the file extension representing the format used in the file. After that, include the necessary front matter. Take a look at the source for this post to get an idea about how it works.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-ruby&quot; data-lang=&quot;ruby&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;print_hi&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;puts&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;Hi, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;si&quot;&gt;#{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;si&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;end&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;print_hi&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;'Tom'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;#=&amp;gt; prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
