<p>Welcome everyone to my new blog. The goal for starting this blog - write more and do it beautiful.</p>

<p>English is not my first language even not second but I use it everyday.
Nowadays we communicate in text format a lot and be able to communicate ideas is very important skill. Be able to explain ideas clear and understandable is not bad, right? :)</p>

<p>I would love to increase my writting skills by writing more and regulary. I’m not sure how it will looks like and about what I’ll write. 
It might be a long post or just few sentances but I’ll try to do it often.</p>

<p>So, this is my first post, let’s see where this leads.</p>
