<p>Welcome to my blog. The goal for starting this blog - write more and do it frequently.</p>

<p>English is not my first language, even not second, but I use it every day.
We communicate in text format a lot. Be able to explain ideas clearly and understandable is not bad :)</p>

<p>I would love to increase my writing skills by writing more and regularly. I’m not sure how it will look like and about what I’ll write. 
It might be a long post or just a few sentences but I’ll try to do it often.</p>

<p>So, this is my first post. Let’s see where this leads.</p>
